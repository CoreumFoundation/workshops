## Workshop Overview

This workshop aims to provide a comprehensive guide on updating dynamic data within NFTs. Participants will learn about the basics of NFTs, their applications, and the technical implementation of updating NFT metadata dynamically using CosmWasm contracts for the backend, TypeScript for backend integration, and Next.js for the frontend. By the end of the workshop, attendees will have a functional understanding of how to create, mint, and update dynamic data in NFTs, and deploy their applications using modern deployment platforms.
