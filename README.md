Welcome to our workshop on Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) transfers, a revolutionary technology enabling secure and reliable data and value exchange between different blockchain networks. ⁤⁤IBC is a protocol that allows independent, sovereign blockchains to communicate and transact with each other, thus creating an interconnected ecosystem of blockchains. ⁤
