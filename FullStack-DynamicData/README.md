![WebappUI](/public/app.png)


## Overview

This project demonstrates how to update dynamic data within NFTs. It uses Go for the backend, handling blockchain transactions and smart contract interactions, Axios for fetching APIs, and Next.js for the frontend, providing a user interface to interact with the NFTs.

Participants will learn about the basics of NFTs, their applications, and the technical implementation of updating NFT metadata dynamically using Go for the backend, Axios for backend API interactions, and React.js for the frontend. By the end of the workshop, attendees will have a functional understanding of how to create, mint, and update dynamic data in NFTs.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Understand the architecture of NFTs and their dynamic data capabilities.
- Set up a development environment with Go and React.
- Build Http server and middleware in Golang
- Interact backend with your React Application
- Interact with the Coreum blockchain to create, mint, and update NFTs.

## Prerequisites

Before attending the workshop, please ensure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of the blockchain ecosystem.
- Experience with JavaScript and TypeScript.
- Familiarity with Node.js and npm package management.
- Basic knowledge of Go programming language.
- A code editor of your choice installed (e.g., VS Code).
